# Advanced Reinforcement Learning Course

Welcome to the repository for the CS 7180 special topics in AI course, focusing on Advanced Reinforcement Learning for Ph.D. students. This comprehensive course covers a wide range of topics, including fundamental concepts such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Dynamic Programming, Temporal-Difference Learning, Q-learning, SARSA, and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

As the course progresses, we delve into more advanced techniques, exploring Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) with algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN), Policy Gradient (PG), and actor-critic methods such as REINFORCE, DDPG, and PPO. Our journey extends beyond the basics to cover Partially Observable RL, Multi-agent RL, and Representation Learning within the context of Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, we explore the practical application of RL in the field of Robotics.
