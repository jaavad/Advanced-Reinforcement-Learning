# Exercise 1: Multi-Armed Bandits

## Setup

* Python 3.5+ (for type hints)

Install requirements with the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Complete the code

### Code structure

- The multi-armed bandit environment is defined in `env.py`
- Epsilon-greedy/UCB agents are given in `agents.py`. Both agents inherit the abstract class `BanditAgent`.
- To break ties randomly, we define our own argmax function in `agents.py`.
- The main file to run code is `main.py`, with functions for each question.

Fill in the sections marked with `TODO`. The docstrings for each function should help you get started. The starter code is designed to only guide you and you are free to use it as-is or modify it however you like.

## Run the code

```bash
python main.py
```
